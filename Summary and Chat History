I am going to try to prompt the AI in a way that is "ground up". I will begin with a very simple prompt that tells ChatGPT Pro what persona to take on, what core game mechanics matter, and how I want it to approach complex graphics coding. After each iteration, I will then run the code and have the AI complete "bounded tasks" a self-made term that I use to describe prompts that specifically tell the AI to only fix/work on one problem. I want to do minimal self debugging, so I think such bounded tasks will be very important!
